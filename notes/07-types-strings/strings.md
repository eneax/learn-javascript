# Strings

Strings are used for holding text.

## Part 1 - Intro to Strings

In JavaScript, we can create strings in three different ways: `single quotes`, `double quotes` and `backticks`.

```js
const name = 'Enea';
const middle = "X";
const last = `Xharja`;

// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
const sentence = 'it's so cool!';

const sentence2 = "it's sooo cool!";
const sentence3 = 'it\'s sooo cool!';

const sentence4 = "it's sooo \"cool\"!";
const sentence5 = `it's sooo "cool"!`;
```

Single quotes and double quotes are similar, but we have both of them as a way to fix the `Unexpected identifier` error generated by the apostrophe (`'`), which is being considered as a single quote character.

You can fix the `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier` error in two ways:

- using the escape key or backslash (`\`)
- using double quotes

However, even combining the single and double quotes, strings can get unreadable.
We can avoid all these issues mentioned above, by simply using `backticks`.

## Part 2 - Strings on multiple lines

```js
const song = "It's

Xmas

Time
";

const song2 = `It's

Xmas

Time
`;

const html = `

  <div>
    <h2>JSX</h2>
  </div>
`
```

The song variable will generate the following error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`

It can be fixed:

- by adding a backslash at the end of every line
- or simply using `backticks`

Backticks, indeed, are an ideal solution when you have to use HTML in your JS.

## Part 3 - String concatenation and interpolation

- Concatenation --> two or more string are combined into one
- Interpolation --> when you put a variable inside a string

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Concatenation example
const hello = 'Hello, my name is ' + name + '. Nice to meet you!';

// overwrite the variable 'hello2' every single line
let hello2 = "Hello, my name is ";
hello2 = hello2 + name;
hello2 = hello2 + '. Nice to meet you!';

// Interpolation example
const hello3 = `Hello, my name is ${name}. Nice to meet you! I'm ${2020 - 1992} years old`;

const html = `
  <div>
    <h1>${name}</h1>
  </div>
`;
```
