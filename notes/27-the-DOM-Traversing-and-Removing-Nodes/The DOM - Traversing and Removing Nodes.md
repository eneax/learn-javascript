# The DOM - Traversing and Removing Nodes

Traversing the DOM is the act of selecting an element from another element.
It allows us to move up and down the DOM from children to parent elements.

Some common properties for elements include (they ignore plain text nodes):

- firstElementChild
- lastElementChild
- previousElementSibling
- nextElementSibling
- parentElement

Some common properties for nodes include (they don't ignore plain text nodes):

- childNodes
- firstChild
- lastChild
- previousSibling
- nextSibling
- parentNode
