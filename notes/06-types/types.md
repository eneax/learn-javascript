# Types

Anytime you have a value, like something that can be assigned into a variable or something that can be passed into a function, it falls into one of the seven categories of types in JavaScript:

- String
- Number
- Object
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol

Primitive types: all the above with the exception of objects (special type).

## String

We talk about strings, anytime there is a text wrapped into single quotes (`''`), double quotes (`""`) and backticks (``).
Basically strings are used to hold text.

## Numbers

There is only one type of number in JavaScript and it's `Number`.
It includes numbers that have or do not have decimal in them.

## Object

Everything in JavaScript is an object.

## Boolean

A value that can be true or false.

## Null and Undefined

Both of these types are used to set a value to `nothing`.

## Symbol

It's a new JavaScript type that always gives us a guaranty of a unique identifier. Very useful, when you have to come up with an id value inside an object.
