! How to run and load JS

* 1. script tag
- The script tag allows us to write JavaScript inside an HTML file
- In order for the script tag to select an element on the page, the element itself must be on the page
- Always remember to add the script tag just before the closing body tag

* 2. import a `.js` file
- Use a script tag for a source attribute with a relative path, in order to import a new JavaScript file

* 3. run JS in node.js
- Node.js is JavaScript that can run in the server, instead of making it run in the context of a website
  - Open your terminal and type `node`. To exit, press `^C`.
  - Or, from the terminal, navigate to a folder containing a `.js` file and type `node example.js` to run whatever code contained inside `example.js` file. When it will finish executing, it will exit automatically

* Things to keep in mind
- script tags are not self closing -> <script></script>
- if you use a script tag with a source attribute, then you cannot run JavaScript code inside that script
- You can have multiple script tags, but the main drawback is that it will increase the number of requests made by the page and the performance will be bad
- We can avoid having multiple scripts, using modules or code splitting
- Module allow us to bundle several script tags into one unique file
- Code splitting consists in splitting the script into many JS files and have them load on demand
