<!-- 
* There are 3 ways of declaring variables in JS: 

! 1. var
! 2. let
! 3. const

* Main differences
- Once you declare a variable with var and let, you can update it (there is no need to re-declare them)
- If you declare a variable with const, you cannot update it.
- const is very useful for declaring constants (stuff that will never change), like an API key

<!-- 
* Statement
A statement is an instruction that developers give to the computer, or browser or interpreter to do something.
For instance, We can give an instruction to create a variable or to modify one.

Any time you want to do something in JS, that is referred to as a `statement`.

This line represents a `statement` -> var first = "enea";

* Semicolon
As you can see, it ends with a semicolon.
The semicolon is needed to terminate a line in JavaScript.

* Semicolon and code blocks
However, if we have a code block (things bound by curly brackets): 
```
if (age > 18) {
  console.log('You can get a driving licence!');
}
```
then there is no need for a semicolon, since you are not telling the computer to do something.
You are just running some code and the instructions will be contained inside the code block.

* Strict Mode -> 'use strict';
It's a new mode that has been introduced to the browser for backward compatibility reasons.

When JavaScript was first introduced, it was possible to declare a variable without using 'var'.
The browser, then, would add 'var' for you. 
These practices, however, could lead to a lot of bugs down the road. 
So the strict mode was introduced, as a way to patch bad JS code wrote in the past, without actually breaking those apps. 

Strict mode is enforced by default when using JavaScript modules.
